## 🔍 What Each Component Did

### During System Build:

```
1. Read document → 5 chunks created

2. FAISS Vector DB:
   ✅ Indexed 5 vectors
   ✅ Ready for semantic search

3. Gemini + NetworkX:
   ✅ Processed chunk 1/5 → Extracted triples
   ✅ Processed chunk 2/5 → Extracted triples
   ✅ Processed chunk 3/5 → Extracted triples
   ✅ Processed chunk 4/5 → Extracted triples
   ✅ Processed chunk 5/5 → Extracted triples
   ✅ Built graph: 50 entities, 37 relationships

4. PyVis Visualization:
   ✅ Generated knowledge_graph.html
```

### During Query:

```
Query: "Who created Claude?"
   ↓
1. FAISS: Retrieved relevant chunks
   ↓
2. Gemini: Extracted entity ["Claude"]
   ↓
3. NetworkX: Queried graph for "Claude" relationships
   ↓
4. Gemini: Reasoned over context
   ↓
Answer: "Anthropic"
   ↓
5. Self-Learning: Added Q&A to vector DB + graph
```
